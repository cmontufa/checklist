<h1>Checklist : Purpose</h1>
<p>A group of us work as software developers in an environment where the majority of
our production code deployment and testing work happens on weekends.  A weekend implementation
can involve multiple systems being tested by multiple groups at different times throughout
the day, with the schedule being managed by a "test coordinator" using an Excel spreadsheet.
It can be challenging for the test coordinator to keep the spreadsheet updated in real time, 
not to mention provide access to everyone who is interested in the status of work on a Saturday. 
"Where are we at?" is a question we hear asked dozens of times by multiple people on a Saturday.
Depending on who is asking, this can result in a time-wasting scramble for the team to provide 
status.
</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Checklist application is to build a system that replaces the
spreadsheet used by the test coordinator during a weekend system implementation.  A Checklist
"template" is created in the application, with steps and step owners defined in the template.
When it's time to do some work, a person can "execute" a checklist, and the step owners
can use the checklist application to confirm that they've completed the work that
comprises their step(s) in the checklist.  Interested parties can view the checklist in
real time and see what's been completed, what's left to complete, what steps depend on
other steps, what the expected duration of the remaining work is, etc...
</p>
<p>
A secondary purpose of the Checklist application is learning.  Checklist is a
Hibernate/Spring/Spring MVC application that uses Lucene, jquery and backbone.js.
It is serving as a way for a group of us to hone our software design and development
skills.
