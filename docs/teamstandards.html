<h1>Checklist : Team Development Standards</h1>
<ul>
<li>Small classes with few methods are far better than large classes with lots of methods.</li>
<li>Small methods are far better than large methods.</li>
<li>Use meaningful names for classes, methods and variables.</li>
<li>Use javadoc comments on classes and public methods.  If you feel you need to add comments to private methods or within the body of a method, consider refactoring.
Comments are not necessary for POJO accessors/mutators (getters/setters).</li>
<li>Keep comments short, simple, and to the point.</li>
<li>When you update code, update any relevant comments</li>
<li>Anything that can be unit tested should be pushed/merged with automated unit test(s).</li>
<li>Test code should be developed with the same attention to detail and care as any other code.</li>
<li>If you have to refactor code in order to test it, by all means refactor the code!</li>
<li>Abide by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">
Single Responsibility Principle</a>.  Every class and method you write should have one responsibility.</li>
<li><b><i>Never push or merge code that has not been thoroughly tested.</i></b> Your 
code is your reputation.</li>
<li>Use checkstyle with the included configuration, and validate your code 
with it before pushing/merging</li>
<li>Use findbugs and validate your code with it before pushing/merging.</li>
<li>Check your code out in Sonar before pushing/merging, and make sure it does not introduce
any rule violations or other quality issues.</li>
<li>Cutting &amp; pasting code is evil.  Write small, reusable methods and reuse them where possible!</li>
<li>Avoid reinventing the wheel.  Gain some familiarity with existing code as well as the project dependencies, and
consider using existing code before writing redundant code.  For example, familiarize yourself with commons-lang and commons-beanutils.
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Most Importantly - Follow the Golden Rule.</b>  Treat others the way you'd like to be treated.  Remember that
your code will likely be maintained and extended by others.  Don't make it hard for them.</li>
</ul>
